- [`retrieve_sequences_by_name.pl`](/fasta/retrieve_sequences_by_name.pl): Retrieves query sequences by name from fasta file.

   _Usage: `perl retrieve_sequences_by_name.pl [fasta file path] [query sequence name 1] [query sequence name 2] [etc.]`_
   
- [`summarize_fasta_sequences.pl`](/fasta/summarize_fasta_sequences.pl): Summarizes sequences in fasta file (number bases, number unambiguous bases, A+T, C+G, Ns, gaps, As, Ts, Cs, Gs, other bases).

   _Usage: `perl summarize_fasta_sequences.pl [fasta file path]`_


More coming soon :)
