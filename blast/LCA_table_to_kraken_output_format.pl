# Converts LCA output table to kraken output format. Treats paired reads as separate reads.

# Input table is output of retrieve_top_blast_hits_LCA_for_each_sequence.pl, with
# column titles (tab-separated):
# - sequence_name
# - LCA_taxon_id
# - LCA_taxon_rank
# - LCA_taxon_species
# - LCA_taxon_genus
# - LCA_taxon_family
# - evalue_of_top_hits
# - lowest_pident_of_top_hits
# - mean_pident_of_top_hits
# - highest_pident_of_top_hits
# - lowest_qcovs_of_top_hits
# - mean_qcovs_of_top_hits
# - highest_qcovs_of_top_hits
# - number_top_hits

# Kraken output format:
# https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.markdown#standard-kraken-output-format


# Usage:
# perl LCA_table_to_kraken_output_format.pl
# [output of retrieve_top_blast_hits_LCA_for_each_sequence.pl for one blast search]
# [fasta file that was input to blast search (to retrieve sequence lengths and names of unclassified sequences)] 


# Prints to console. To print to file, use
# perl LCA_table_to_kraken_output_format.pl
# [output of retrieve_top_blast_hits_LCA_for_each_sequence.pl for one blast search]
# [fasta file that was input to blast search (to retrieve sequence lengths and names of unclassified sequences)]
# > [output kraken format table]
